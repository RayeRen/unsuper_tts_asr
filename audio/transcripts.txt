the earliest book printed with movable types the gutenberg or "forty-two line bible" of about fourteen fifty-five
has never been surpassed
now as all books not primarily intended as picture-books consist principally of types composed to form letterpress
especially as no more time is occupied or cost incurred in casting setting or printing beautiful letters
than in the same operations with ugly ones
the forms of printed letters should be beautiful and that their arrangement on the page should be reasonable and a help to the shapeliness of the letters themselves
the first books were printed in black letter ie the letter which was a gothic development of the ancient roman character
the earliest book printed with movable type the aforesaid gutenberg bible is printed in letters which are an exact imitation
of the more formal ecclesiastical writing which obtained at that time this has since been called "missal type"
